> If you are interested in pursuing a B.S.E. (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) degree,
  please write a 300-500 word essay describing why you are interested in studying engineering,
  any experiences in or exposure to engineering you have had,
  and how you think the programs in engineering offered at Princeton suit your particular interests.

I started taking engineering classes my freshman year of high school.
It was a young a program with a newly built lab and I was super pumped.
The goal of the class was to imitate a real engineering job, so there were no tests, just projects.

Engineering and programming are about solving problems.
I like the challenge; I like it when people can enjoy the fruits of my labor.
