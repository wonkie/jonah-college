Neal Stephenson's *Snowcrash* is a world of sophisticated technology and extreme poverty.
It is a society where governments have been totally privatized, and religions and neighborhoods turn into businesses.
While some schools of political thought would praise this world as efficient and economically free, I was troubled by its inequality.

The most concerning aspect of *Snowcrash* was its plausibility; the pressure to fully yield power to corporations exists in our current system.
As a programmer and a reader of the technology section of the New York Times, I am well aware of the ravenous energy of Silicon Valley.
The desire for wealth has driven a lot of progress, but there is an accompanying disregard for the value of existing institutions, exemplified by Facebook's former motto: "move fast and break things."
The institutions of democracy are particularly sensitive to disruption.
In *Snowcrash*, even the judiciary system is bought with money.
Focusing on money as a means in and of itself prevents us from seeing the central role that honor and morality play in the functioning of society.
Money is a convenient way to distribute things of value, but few would want to live in a world where every action is motivated by a desire to increase one's net worth.
It may seem obvious, but it is critical lesson in an age of corporate consolidation and massive lobbying efforts.
To keep *Snowcrash* a fiction, we must hold human dignity above profits.
