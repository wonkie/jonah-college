Neal Stephenson's *Snowcrash* paints a world of sophisticated technology and extreme poverty.
It is a society where governments have been totally privatized, and religions and neighborhoods turn into businesses.
Though taken to an extreme, *Snowcrash* was written to reflect trends and tendencies that are all around us.  
As a programmer and a reader of the technology section of the New York Times, I am well aware of the ravenous energy of Silicon Valley.
On the flip side, I look forward to contributing to the field of artificial intelligence and therfore helping people, such as by improving early diagnosis of diseases.
*Snowcrash* is a warning that corporate control of everything leaves little room for self-determination.
Already, consumer data is controlled by only a handful of comapnies.
We need a compassionate world view, one that values human dignity over coporate profits.
