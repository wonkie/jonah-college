I don't know what love is, but I know I love a binary file. I'm referring to a program called Git, and it can change the world.

I began programming in elementary school. I knew my dad did something with computers, and it didn't look too much harder than typing funky green text into a black terminal. The early work I did was mostly dragging and dropping blocks to make a cat dance on the screen (in a language called Scratch), but I could tell that I was brushing the surface of a deep field.

I was peer pressured into transitioning from Scratch--a "graphical" language--to a traditional text-based language. A friend, disillusioned with the inefficiencies of Scratch, showed me how abandoning Scratch meant I could take advantage of a whole community of developers, and, of course, stop using a language designed for kids.

In high school, I began working on more complicated projects; programming robots, web apps, extensions, and satellites. I learned to love and hate the power of a teamwork in software development. Throughout my work, I found it hard to shake the feeling that I could do everything much faster alone. I found it equally hard to ignore the fact that collaboration made my end-results more robust and full-featured. These programming experiences taught me much, but left me feeling like there was a better way.

One lovely summer, I discovered Git. Ah, in that single syllable, a whole new way of thinking. Git is a source code management system, useful for tracking versions or collaborating on a programming task. Every change becomes a part of a tree-like structure where new features branch off a main trunk and merge back in once completed. The tree shows the history of the project, its present state, and areas for growth. But, the real magic of Git is the distributed model. If I find a project online that I think I could improve, I just do it. Then other people can use my work or I can directly suggest my improvements to the creator.

This basic idea could be applied to create a more decentralized model for society. Good ideas naturally gather more followers, but it doesn't stop there. Anyone, no matter where they come from, can make suggestions and have a voice. Imagine the laws of a country as a Git project. Constant iteration means no more outdated, unpopular, unethical laws on the books. Laws nimbly move to fix the latest attack on consumers or infringement of minority rights. 

Fundamental openness is why I say I'm in love with Git. It represents the freedom to branch out and try new things without fear of repercussions, a collaborative environment without reliance on fast internet connections, a workplace of equality without ignoring individual achievements. I want to make a mark on computer science, a mark on the world. But if that mark is flawed, as I've learned all first versions of programs are, I want a good source code management system, so I can perfect that mark.
