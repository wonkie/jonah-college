I started competing in Zero Robotics my freshman year. It was terrifying. Surrounded by smart
people who would casually agree to write C++ code to manipulate vectors to rotate a satelitte
before the next meeting, I felt lost.
After a year of experience within ZR and from Engineering class, I had the skills necessary to
contribute code. From my new perspective, I saw that much of what I had observed the previous year was deceiving;
the people with experience did not actually devote much time to working on the competition 
and many of my teammates were in the same position I had been in the last year: totally lost.
The lack of work being done frustrated me, and, as a result, I wrote most of the code that year.
The leader of the club noticed; I was named co-leader starting when the competition
ended. With the remaining months of the year, I sought to bring the newer members up to speed
on how to code. All the other members were interested in ZR and were willing to invest some time
learning to code, but prior to then, they simply did not have the resources available to get up
to speed. I created a training regimen with competition related tasks to complete. I
checked in with my teammates during meetings. If I saw someone struggling to understand why we
would divide a vector by its magnitude, I'd draw a picture. The next year, I was able to assign
tasks and know they would be completed.

I like creating systems. I see teams as very complicated system composed of networks of
interaction. A good system is efficient and robust; if someone has a lot of homework, other
members can pick up the slack. As a leader, my role is to facilitate the efficient and appropriate
transfer of knowledge between members of my team. Holding power gives me no pleasure, but I was
pleased when my team attended the international finals, in part because of the greater inclusion
that I championed.
