I started competing in Zero Robotics (ZR) my freshman year. It was terrifying. Being surrounded by smart
people who would casually agree to write C++ code to manipulate vectors to rotate a satellite
before the next meeting was overwhelming and intimidating.
But, after a year of experience in ZR and Engineering class, I had the skills and confidence necessary to
contribute code. As a contributor, my teammates appeared differently; 
the people with experience did not actually devote much time to the competition 
and many of my teammates had no understanding of how our code worked or how they could help.
I found the disfunctionality frustrating, so I took the initiative and ended up writing most of the code that year.

The leader of the club noticed my dedication; he named me co-leader starting when the competition
season finished. With the remaining months of the year, I set out to train new members
on how to code. Most members were eager to contribute to ZR and were willing to invest some time in
learning to code, but prior to then, they simply did not have the resources available to get up
to speed. To bridge the gap, I created a training regimen with competition related tasks and
monitored everyone's progress. For someone puzzling over the team's code, struggling to understand why we
would divide a vector by its magnitude, I would draw a picture to explain the underlying concept.
With a better grasp of both math and programming fundamentals, many more people participated in the 
code writing process during the next competition season. As an added benefit, participation by girls increased
significantly, due to the more collaborative culture.

I like creating systems, and that includes programming. To me, a team is just a complicated
system, composed of networks of interaction.
A good system is efficient and robust; if a team member has a lot of homework, others
can pick up the slack. As a leader, my role is to facilitate the efficient and appropriate
transfer of knowledge between members of my team. Holding power gives me no pleasure, but I am
pleased each year when my team qualifies for the international finals, in part because of the greater inclusion
that I championed.
