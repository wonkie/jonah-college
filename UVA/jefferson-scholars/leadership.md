I started competing in Zero Robotics (ZR) my freshman year. It was terrifying. Being surrounded by smart
people who would casually agree to write C++ code to manipulate vectors to rotate a satellite
before the next meeting was overwhelming and intimidating.
But, after a year of experience in ZR and Engineering class, I had the skills and confidence necessary to
contribute code. As a contributor, my teammates appeared differently; 
the people with experience did not actually devote much time to the competition 
and many of my teammates had no understanding of how our code worked or how they could help.
I found the disfunctionality frustrating and, as a result, wrote most of the code that year.
The leader of the club noticed my dedication; He named me co-leader starting when the competition
ended. With the remaining months of the year, I sought to bring the newer members up to speed
on how to code. All the other members were interested in ZR and were willing to invest some time in
learning to code, but prior to then, they simply did not have the resources available to get up
to speed. I created a training regimen with competition related tasks and
checked in with my teammates regularly to make sure they understood.
For someone struggling to understand why we
would divide a vector by its magnitude, I would draw a picture. The next year, many more people
were participated in the code writing process.

I like creating systems. That of course includes programming, but teams are just complicated
systems, composed of networks of interaction.
A good system is efficient and robust; if someone has a lot of homework, other
members can pick up the slack. As a leader, my role is to facilitate the efficient and appropriate
transfer of knowledge between members of my team. Holding power gives me no pleasure, but I am
pleased each year when my team attends the international finals, in part because of the greater inclusion
that I championed.
