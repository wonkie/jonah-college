I started competing in Zero Robotics my freshman year. It was terrifying. Surrounded by smart
people who would agree to write C++ code to rotate a satelitte in a few days, I felt lost.
After a year of experience within ZR and from Engineering class, I felt ready to contribute,
and I was. From this contributing perspective, I saw that much of what I had seen was deceiving;
the people with experience did not actually devote much time and those without experience didn't
understand how to contribute. Despite the uneven distribution of work, I wrote most of the code
that year. The leader of the club noticed; I was named co-leader starting when the competition
ended. With the remaining months of the year, I sought to bring the newer members up to speed
on how to code. All the other members were interested in ZR and were willing to invest some time
learning to code, but prior to then, they simply did not have the resources available to get up
to speed. I created a sort of training regimen with competition related tasks to complete. I
checket in with my teammates during meetings. If I saw someone struggling to understand why we
would divide a vector by its magnitude, I'd draw a picture. The next year, I was able to assign
tasks and know they would be completed.

I like creating systems. I see teams as very complicated networks of interaction. As a leader,
my role is to facilitate the efficient and appropriate transfer of knowledge between members of
my team.
