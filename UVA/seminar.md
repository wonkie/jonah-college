>>  Student self-governance, which encourages student investment and initiative, is a hallmark of the UVA culture.
    In her fourth year at UVA, Laura Nelson was inspired to create Flash Seminars, one-time classes which facilitate high-energy discussion about thought-provoking topics outside of traditional coursework.
    If you created a Flash Seminar, what idea would you explore and why?

Just a few weeks ago, I discovered the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
It reimagines the internet as more permanent, more decentralized network.
Every piece of data on IPFS, like a website, has a fingerprint called a hash.
When you want some data, you ask the network for the hash, and whoever is closest to you transmits it.
There's a lot more detail, of course, but my flash seminar would be about the implications of IPFS and the problems it solves.

In its current state, the internet is dominanted by a handful of powerful players.
Start-ups have little choice but to use Facebook and Google for advertising and Microsoft or Amazon for cloud services.
Some people's entire online experience is filtered through Facebook.
Corporations control your perception of events and the data that represents who you are. 
While getting all your news from Facebook and your shopping through Amazon, this arrangement places enormous trust on insitutions that are obligated to make a profit, not protect your interests.
The last presidential election proved that these companies have more power than even they understand.
For the sake of our democracy, we must decentralize that power, and IPFS gives a concrete path to doing so.

The current internet could not cleanly migrate to IPFS; many fundamental design changes would be required.
IPFS applications must be decentralized, which not only creates a more robust system (useful for the developing world) but prevents third-parties from controllling the data.
My flash seminar would be chance for students to explore important themes of privacy and internet freedom, grounded on a real technology.
