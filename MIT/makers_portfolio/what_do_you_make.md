>Describe for us the kind(s) of thing(s) you make. This should be a general overview of your project(s); you will be able to submit pictures and video with specific descriptions later. Often, the most helpful explanations for Maker Portfolios emerge in the captions to the portfolios, where they can form a kind of narrative to help us understand how a project or projects unfolded.

For my four years of high school, I've competeted in Zero Robotics, a programming challenge in which teams control experimental satellites on board the International Space Station. Due to the complexity of the code, a lot of coordination is required for a successful team. In previous years, my team has had issues with the wrong code getting submitted and important worked being overwritten. 

In order to address the issues I observed, I developed a Chrome extension that allows competitors in the Zero Robotics Challenge to use a source code management system from the competition's web editor. Before implimenting my extension, team members would search a shared Google Drive folder. However, lacking consistent naming conventions, finding the most recent version of the code was difficult to say the least. Using my extension, finding the desired code was a simple as selecting from a drop down menu.
