## The problem
Zero Robotics (ZR) is a competition where teams of 5-25 people compete by writing code to control satellites.
Except for the finals, all participation in the competition happens through [the ZR website](http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/).

### The ZR Integrated Development Environment
In order to compile code and simulate games, participants must use the ZR Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
It is a relatively simple interface:
![The ZR IDE -- TODO: add annotations](/MIT/makers_portfolio/img/zr_ide.png)

The IDE is perfectly workable for an individual coder, but when multiple people need to work on the same code, problems arise.
ZR has very stringent codesize limits due to the age of the hardware: only 1500 compiler words.
Most years, my team's final code submission, the result of countless man-hours, is only a few hundred lines.
Unlike in larger projects where team members can work on distinct modules, changes are likely to be conflicting.

### Google Drive
The ZR IDE allows files to be shared through Google Drive.
