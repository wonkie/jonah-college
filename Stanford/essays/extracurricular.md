Many days, I have come home from school, started working on Zero Robotics, and not stopped for seven hours.
During the competition season, improving my team’s code becomes my singular passion.
My satisfaction comes from the unique pleasure of imagining and then creating some functionality in a program, coupled with recognition from my teammates.
I find comfort in this all-consuming focus on a productive goal; knowing that — at least in this competition — success can be bought with long hours and tired eyes.
