Just a few weeks ago, I discovered the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
It reimagines the internet as more permanent, more decentralized network.
Every piece of data on IPFS, like a website, has a fingerprint called a hash.
When you want some data, you ask the network for the hash, and whoever is closest to you transmits it.

IPFS solves a number of problems of the internet, which, in its current state, is dominanted by a handful of powerful players.
Corporations control your perception of events and the data that represents who you are.
While getting all your news from Facebook and your shopping through Amazon is convenient, this arrangement places enormous trust in insitutions that are obligated to make a profit, not protect your interests.
The last presidential election proved that these companies have more power than even they understand.
For the sake of our democracy, we must decentralize that power, and IPFS gives a concrete path to doing so.

The current internet could not cleanly migrate to IPFS; many fundamental design changes would be required.
IPFS applications must be decentralized, which not only creates a more robust system (useful for the developing world) but prevents third-parties from controllling the data.
I am eager to help IPFS succeed and learn more about decentralized systems, so I have found that contributing to the open-source projects of the IPFS community is the best way to do that.
