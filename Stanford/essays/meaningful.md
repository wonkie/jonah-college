A small food fight around the lunch table.
Some clementine peels are thrown.
The fight dissolves in laughter, but the peels remain on the ground.
The peel throwers fail to see the need to dispose of them, citing their organic nature and compostability.
In a courtyard already littered with trash, I am disheartened by my friends lack of respect for their surroundings.
In perhaps an overly dramatic display, I put the peels in my lunch box, so I can compost them at home and then pick up trash from the courtyard for the rest of lunch.
I sometimes assume that the importance of respect for the environment has been drilled into everyone as thoroughly has it has been into me.

Six years of going to Nature Camp has given me an understanding of the incredible biodiversity of the natural world.
My family has always made efforts to conserve water, reduce waste, and promote clean energy by installing solar panels.
As global temperatures rise and weather becomes more extreme, there is more need than ever for awareness of the effect of human actions of the environment.
While I do not plan to directly work on protecting the environment, my actions will always be informed by concern for the natural world.
