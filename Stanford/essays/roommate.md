Every Sunday, I check out the latest batch of surreal and deep fried memes.
For the uninitiated, deep fried memes are a genre that applies grainy, saturated filters to images about popular culture.
They tend to be embrace long overlooked cultural artifacts, like CoolMath-Games.com, and make judicious use of emojis.
Their absurdity is no match for surreal memes, however.
As the name would suggest, surreal memes aim to make the viewer question reality.
These memes make astute cultural observations, such as "haha mortal you thought the void had no cactus, but here is the void and clearly there is a cactus."
They take nothing seriously, which is refreshing.
I sometimes feel called upon to share a little light-hearted "memery". 
My roommate doesn't have to share my taste in memes, but he should at least know what to expect from me.
