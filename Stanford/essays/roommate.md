  Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate -- and us -- know you better.
  (100 to 250 words)

For the first two and half years of my life, I had no roommate.
My brother Tim changed that.
For most of our 10 years as roommates, we slept in bunk beds.
We kept the borders of our territory well-defined.
Tim filled his space with random stuff he found the street, and I kept mine clean.

Other than abstaining from kicking the underside of my bed, as my brother sometimes did, I don't have many requirements for living together.
I'm good at respecting other people's spaces, as long as they do the same for me.
