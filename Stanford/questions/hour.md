> Imagine you had an extra hour in the day â€” how would you spend that time?
  (50 word limit).

I have recently picked up journaling.
It gives a place to digest my thoughts and feelings.
Journaling helps me sort vacuous impulses from logical courses of action.
Finding time to journal is often difficult and extra hour a day would be much appreciated.
