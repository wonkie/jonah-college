> Imagine you had an extra hour in the day â€” how would you spend that time?
  (50 word limit).

I recently started journaling.
It gives a place to digest my thoughts and feelings, and it helps me sort vacuous impulses from logical courses of action.
Finding time to journal is often difficult and extra hour would give me time to thoughtfully reflect on my day.
