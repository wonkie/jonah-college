> How did you spend your last two summers?
  (50 word limit)

Two summers ago, I stayed at a nature camp, hiking and studying the natural world.

Last summer, I participated in the Virginia Governor's School working at NASA Langley, where I messed around with unsupervised machine learning.

I also coded JavaScript for an internship at a local financial technology start-up.
