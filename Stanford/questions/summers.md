> How did you spend your last two summers?
  (50 word limit)

Two summers ago, I stayed at a nature camp for two weeks, hiking and learning about the natural world.

Last summer, I worked at NASA, where I messed around with unsupervised machine learning.
I also coded ReactJS for a internship at a local financial technology start-up.
