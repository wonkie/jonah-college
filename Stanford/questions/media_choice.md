> When the choice is yours, what do you read, listen to, or watch?
  (50 word limit)

I don't have a rule for determining what I consume because the things that fall into my hands seldom fail to intrigue me.
I read about honor and sources of moral authority.
I listen to pieces from orchestra or Wes Anderson soundtracks.
I watch my dad's classic movie suggestions.
