Starting at my programming internship, I was intimidated.
This was my first job, and first time working on one thing for 8 hours a day.
When I arrived, I was shown a quick demo of the existing code and then given an overview of what my final product should look like.
My mentor rattled off a handful of technologies and set me loose to spend hours puzzling over Flux data flows and EcmaScript promises.
I felt bad asking for help from my colleagues because my work was not as important to the company as theirs.
After a few days, I got over the culture shock, started chatting with my co-workers, and asked for help.
The truth is most people like being helpful; my co-workers were happy to explain things to me, and their explanations didn't keep them from their own work for very long.
