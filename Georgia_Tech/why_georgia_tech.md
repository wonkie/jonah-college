Georgia Tech has an excellent machine learning program, a field that I am very much interested in studying.
I recently read the research section of the ML@GT website, and, from bioinformatics to manufacturing optimization, each topic sounded intriguing.
I am fascinated by the power of machine learning to do what seemed impossible a few decades ago, like natural language processing and autonomous navigation.
I would like to keep pushing the boundary of the possible at Georgia Tech.
